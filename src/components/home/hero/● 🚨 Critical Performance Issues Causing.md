● 🚨 Critical Performance Issues Causing <50% 
  Lighthouse Score

  Based on my analysis, here are ALL the remaining 
  performance bottlenecks keeping your website below
  50%:

  ---
  1. 🎥 MASSIVE VIDEO FILES (Critical - 19MB)

  Impact: Largest performance killer

  - HeroSectionVideo.mp4: 11MB
  - HeroSectionVideoIntro.mp4: 8.3MB
  - Total: 19.3MB of videos loaded on initial page        
  visit

  Problems:
  - Videos load immediately on page load
  - No compression for mobile devices
  - No progressive loading or streaming
  - Blocks page rendering until loaded
  - Consumes enormous bandwidth on mobile

  ---
  2. 📦 HEAVY JAVASCRIPT BUNDLE (189KB First Load)        

  Impact: Blocks page interactivity

  Unused Heavy Dependencies Still Loaded:
  - @mui/material + @emotion packages (30-40KB) -
  Still in dependencies despite removal from
  HeroSection
  - Framer Motion (25-30KB) - Used across 10+
  components
  - Lucide React (15-20KB) - Large icon library
  - styled-components (10-15KB) - Unused styling
  library
  - React 19 - Bleeding edge, potentially unstable        

  ---
  3. 🖼️ UNOPTIMIZED IMAGES (49MB Public Folder)

  Impact: Slow loading, layout shifts

  Problems:
  - 49MB total in public folder
  - Mixed formats (PNG, JPG, WebP)
  - No responsive image sizes
  - No lazy loading priority
  - Certificate images not optimized
  - Product showcase images likely oversized

  ---
  4. ⚡ RENDER-BLOCKING RESOURCES

  Impact: Delays First Contentful Paint

  - 8 Dynamic Imports in BelowFoldClient loading
  simultaneously
  - Heavy Skeleton Components with complex animations     
  - Framer Motion animations blocking initial render      
  - MUI imports still present in other components

  ---
  5. 🎯 BELOW-FOLD LOADING ISSUES

  Impact: Poor perceived performance

  BelowFoldClient Problems:
  // 8 heavy components loaded at once
  ProductShowcase, ServicesSection, FeaturesSection,      
  IndustriesCarousel, SneakPeek, ContactSection,
  ClientTestimonialSection, Footer

  - All components use Framer Motion (heavy
  animations)
  - No progressive loading strategy
  - Skeleton loaders add overhead instead of helping      

  ---
  6. 📱 MOBILE PERFORMANCE KILLERS

  - 19MB videos served to mobile devices
  - No mobile-optimized assets
  - Complex animations on limited CPU/battery
  - Full desktop bundles sent to mobile

  ---
  7. 🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES

  Dependencies Mismatch:
  - Still importing @emotion and @mui packages
  - styled-components unused but bundled
  - Multiple animation libraries (Framer Motion + CSS)    

  Component Structure:
  - PerformanceMetrics component adds overhead
  - Complex state management still present in multiple    
   components
  - Skeleton components heavier than actual content       

  ---
  8. 🔄 UNNECESSARY PROCESSING

  - useReducedMotion hook called multiple times
  - Intersection Observers running on multiple
  components
  - Complex animation calculations on every render        
  - Redundant re-renders from multiple useEffect hooks

  📊 Estimated Impact on Lighthouse Score:

  1. Videos (19MB): -25 points (largest impact)
  2. JS Bundle Size: -10 points
  3. Unoptimized Images: -8 points
  4. Render Blocking: -5 points
  5. Mobile Issues: -7 points

  Total Performance Loss: ~55 points
  Current Score: ~45-50% (would be 100% without these     
  issues)

  ---
  🎯 Priority Fix Order for 50%+ Score:

  1. URGENT: Optimize/lazy-load videos
  2. HIGH: Remove unused dependencies
  3. HIGH: Optimize images and lazy loading
  4. MEDIUM: Simplify below-fold loading
  5. MEDIUM: Reduce animation complexity

  The 19MB video files are by far your biggest
  performance killer and should be addressed first for    
   immediate impact.
